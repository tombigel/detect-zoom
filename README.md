Cross Browser Zoom and Pixel Ratio Detector
======
------

### READ THIS: Detect-zoom is currently unusable for desktop
### READ THIS: Also broken on Chrome/Android.

Last update: Aug 7 2013

**In the past few months both Mozilla and Google made some changes to their browsers that make it almost impossible to do 
what detect-zoom is here to do:**

#### Firefox
On *Firefox 18* Mozilla changes the `devicePixelRatio` value on manual zoom (cmd/ctrl +/-), making it impossible
to know whether the browser is in zoom mode or is it a retina device, ignoring what the word DEVICE represents.  
I personally believe someone there refuses to admit this is a mistake and revert this decision.

#### Chrome
On *Chrome 27* (Meaning WebKit and Blink) `webkitTextSizeAdjust` was deprecated on desktops versions of the browser. 
This was the only bullet proof way to detect zoom in desktop chrome that I am aware of.  
There are couple of other ways, but they don't cover all the bases - one uses SVG but is not working in iFrames, the other 
uses window.inner/outerWidth and is not working when there is a sidebar or the DevTools are open on the side.

### Other Known issues:
* In some multi-monitor enviroments where each monitor has a different 'pixel aspect ratio' windows that span accross both monitors might return false pixelAspectRatio values.

What is this for?
------
Detecting the browser zoom level and device pixel ratio relative to the zoom level.

It can be used to show higher-resolution `canvas` or `img` when necessary,
to warn users that your site's layout will be broken in their current zoom level,
and much more.
Personally I'm maintaining it to use Detect-zoom in [Wix.com](http://wix.com)'s editor to warn users
that their browser is in zoom mode before saving important changes to their website.

What happend to @yonran?
------
Don't worry, he is well.
As of January 2013 [@yonran](https://github.com/yonran) stopped maintaining his source of detect-zoom, and transferred the repository to me.
If you are looking to update previous versions note that there were some breaking changes

* **Major Changes from the latest yonran version:**
    * `DetectZoom` object name changed to `detectZoom`
    * `DetectZoom.ratio()` is no longer publicly accessible
    * Supported browsers: IE8+, FF4+, modern Webkit, mobile Webkit, Opera 11.1+
    * *IE6, IE7, FF 3.6 and Opera 10.x are no longer supported*
    * Added support to be loaded as an AMD and CommonJS module

Live Example
------
See the Live Example section in
http://tombigel.github.com/detect-zoom/

Usage
------
**Detect-zoom has only two public functions:**
* `zoom()`   Returns the zoom level of the user's browser using Javascript.
* `device()`   Returns the device pixel ratio multiplied by the zoom level (Read [more about devicePixelRatio](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_devi.html) at QuirksMode)

```html
<script src="detect-zoom.js"></script>
<script>
  var zoom = detectZoom.zoom();
  var device = detectZoom.device();

  console.log(zoom, device);
</script>
```

**AMD Usage**

```javascript
require(['detect-zoom'], function(detectZoom){
    var zoom = detectZoom.zoom();
});
```

**Installing with NPM**

```bash
> npm install detect-zoom
```

Help Needed
------

***Detect-zoom is not complete, many parts of the code are 6 to 12 months old and I'm still reviewing them
I need help testing different browsers, finding better ways to measure zoom on problematic browsers (ahm.. Firefox.. ahm)
patches are more than welcome.***
