{"google":"","tagline":"Detect zoom level using Javascript","body":"Cross Browser Zoom and Pixel Ratio Detector\r\n======\r\n**Forked from https://github.com/yonran/detect-zoom**  \r\n**As of January 2013 @yonran stopped maintaining his source, and is pointing to this repository**\r\n\r\n**Major changes from the original code:**\r\n* I removed support for old browsers and cleaned up the original code.  \r\nSupported browsres: IE8+, FF4+, modern Webkit, mobile Webkit, Opera 11.1+\r\n* Added AMD and CommonJS support (\"require\" and \"exports\") \r\n\r\n**Detect-zoom has only two external functions:**  \r\n* `zoom()`   Returns the zoom level of the user's browser using Javascript.  \r\n* `device()`   Returns the device pixel ratio multiplied by the zoom level (Read [more about devicePixelRatio](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_devi.html) at QuirksMode)\r\n\r\nThis can be used to show higher-resolution `canvas` or `img` when necessary.  \r\nI'm maitaining it to use Detect-zoom in [Wix.com](http://wix.com)'s editor to warn users that their browser is in zoom mode before saving imporant changes to their wabsite.\r\n\r\n***It is not complete;  \r\nI need help testing different browsers.  \r\nPatches welcome.***\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n------\r\n```html\r\n    <script src=\"detect-zoom.js\"></script>\r\n    <script>\r\n      var zoom = detectZoom.zoom();\r\n      var device = detectZoom.device();\r\n\r\n      console.log(zoom, device);\r\n    </script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAMD Usage\r\n------\r\n```javascript\r\n    require(['detect-zoom'], function(detectZoom){\r\n        var zoom = detectZoom.zoom();\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nLive Example\r\n------\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n------\r\nDetect-zoom is dual-licensed under the WTFPL and MIT license, at the recipient's choice.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
